### Due Wednesday, Oct. 17 at 12 pm on Gradescope. 

1. Please write a half-page description of the research topic you are pursuing --- by now, you should have reduced it down to at most two potential projects, and you should know who your partners are (please list them). Additionally, we would like to see some citations to papers relevant to your project. Finally, on Piazza, please follow the link to the group listing on Google Sheets and fill it out. Don't forget to include a short description of the project topic as well so we can assign TAs to each group!

2. Please watch Terry Sejnowski on [Cortical Travelling Waves: Mechanisms and Computational Principles](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/terry-sejnowski-3-19-18). 

3. Read [this post](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) on understanding LSTMs and [this post](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/) on RNNs. 

4. Submit an at least 1-page (max 5 page) response to Gradescope (see Piazza for some further instructions.) The response should include the following:

  - At least a paragraph for each of items 2 and 3 that summarizes what you found interesting and makes it clear you've done the assignment carefully.

  - Two discussion points/questions you'd like to touch on in class. Also post these on Piazza after you submit your assignment!
