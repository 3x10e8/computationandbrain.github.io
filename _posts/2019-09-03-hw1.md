### Due Tuesday, Sept. 10 at 11:59 pm on Gradescope. 



1. Read Chapter 2: "Neuroscience Overview" of ["The Computational Brain"](https://mitpress-universitypressscholarship-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/view/10.7551/mitpress/9780262533393.001.0001/upso-9780262533393) by Churchland and Sejnowski. 

2. Even though we won't be discussing language and the brain until the second half of the course, read [The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5598/1569)

3. Submit a 1-page response to Gradescope (see Piazza for instructions on how to sign up for the class.) The response should include the following:

  - About a paragraph for each of items 1, 2, and 3 that summarizes what you found interesting and makes it clear you've done the assignment carefully.

  - Two discussion points/questions you'd like to touch on in class.

 

Thanks, and enjoy!
