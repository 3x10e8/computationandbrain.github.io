### Due Tuesday, October 22 at 11:59 pm on Gradescope. 

The purpose of this homework is to reinforce the material on reinforcement learning discussed in class, as well as delve into more details on 

1. (10 pts) Watch this lecture by Matt Botvinick from DeepMind ["The prefrontal cortex as a meta-reinforcement learning system"](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/matthew-botvinick-4-16-18). Write a few paragraphs summarizing what you found interesting. 

2. (10 pts) Read Chapter 1 of Angela Friederici's book [Language Functions in the Brain: From Auditory Input to Sentence Comprehension](https://mitpress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7551/mitpress/9780262036924.001.0001/upso-9780262036924-chapter-002) (available via [CLIO](https://clio.columbia.edu/quicksearch?q=Language+in+Our+Brain%3A+The+Origins+of+a+Uniquely+Human+Capacity&commit=Search)). Note that this is quite long (the equivalent of pages 18-84), so please plan accordingly. Write a few paragraphs about topics you found interesting. Feel free to organize it along the lines of the chapter subsections:
    1. A Cognitive Model of Auditory Language Comprehension
    2. Acoustic-Phonological Processes
    3. From Word Form to Syntactic and Lexical-Semantic Information
    4. Initial Phrase Structure Building
    5. Syntactic Relations during Sentence Processing
    6. Processing Semantic Relations
    7. Thematic Role Assignment: Semantic and Syntactic Features
    8. Processing Prosodic Information
    9. Functional Neuroanatomy of Language Comprehension

3. TBD - Possible math related reinforcement learning problem

4. (5 pts) Submit 2 discussion questions related to the above material. These will be discussed in class.

5. (5 pts) Please prepare a 1-minute project pitch to present in class (no need to submit in writing).

Submit a summary to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/61715).

Thanks, and enjoy!

Here are some interesting/helpful links on reinforcement learning:

- Sutton and Barto's textbook [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) has a chapter on RL and psychology (Chapter 14), and a chapter on RL and neuroscience (Chapter 15). These chapters are pretty readable. The full pdf is available online.

- Dayan and Abbott's textbook covers RL and TD Learning as it relates to neuroscience in Chapter 9. Some of the figures from the class lectures are from this chapter.

- One of the original papers that linked the activity of primate dopamine cells during appetitive conditioning tasks with temporal difference learning was [A Framework for Mesencephalic Dopamine Systems Based on
Predictive Hebbian Learning](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/16/5/1936.full.pdf) by Montague, Dayan, Sejnowski (1996)

- A more recent paper that might be of interest for a project is  
[Models of heterogeneous dopamine signaling in an insect learning and memory center](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/737064v2). The build an RNN based on the fly mushroom body (the center of olfactory learning) in PyTorch and customized the plasticity rules.
