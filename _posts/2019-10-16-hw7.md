### Due Tuesday, October 22 at 11:59 pm on Gradescope. 

NOTE - QUESTION 3 IS STILL BEING FINALIZED 

The purpose of this homework is to reinforce the material on reinforcement learning discussed in class, as well as delve into more details on language and the brain. Language will be the focus of the next few lectures.

1. (10 pts) Watch this lecture by Matt Botvinick from DeepMind ["The prefrontal cortex as a meta-reinforcement learning system"](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/matthew-botvinick-4-16-18). Write a few paragraphs summarizing what you found interesting. 


2. (10-15 pts) Read the first half of Chapter 1 of Angela Friederici's book [Language Functions in the Brain: From Auditory Input to Sentence Comprehension](https://mitpress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7551/mitpress/9780262036924.001.0001/upso-9780262036924-chapter-002) (available via [CLIO](https://clio.columbia.edu/quicksearch?q=Language+in+Our+Brain%3A+The+Origins+of+a+Uniquely+Human+Capacity&commit=Search)) up to and including section 1.5 "Syntactic Relations during Sentence Processing". Note that this is quite long (the equivalent of pages 16-56), so please plan accordingly. Write >=3 paragraphs about topics you found interesting, and try to write in such a way that it is clear you have read most if not all of the chapter. Feel free to organize it along the lines of the chapter subsections:
    1. A Cognitive Model of Auditory Language Comprehension
    2. Acoustic-Phonological Processes
    3. From Word Form to Syntactic and Lexical-Semantic Information
    4. Initial Phrase Structure Building
    5. Syntactic Relations during Sentence Processing

3. TBD - Possible math related reinforcement learning problem

4. (5 pts) Submit 2 discussion questions related to the above material. These will be discussed in class.

5. (5 pts) Please prepare a 1-minute (oral) project pitch to present in class. There is no need to submit in writing - you will get credit for this by giving your pitch in class. If you are working in group, you can present together. You will have some time in class after the discussion to chat with other students about projects.

Submit a ~2-3 page summary to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/61715).

Thanks, and enjoy!

---------------

- As a point of interest, one of the main papers referenced in the Botvinick talk is [Prefrontal cortex as a meta-reinforcement learning system](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0147-8). 

Here are some interesting/helpful links on reinforcement learning:

- Sutton and Barto's textbook [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) has a chapter on RL and psychology (Chapter 14), and a chapter on RL and neuroscience (Chapter 15). These chapters are pretty readable. The full pdf is available online.

- Dayan and Abbott's textbook [Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/columbia/detail.action?docID=3338869) (available via [CLIO](https://clio.columbia.edu/quicksearch?q=Theoretical+Neuroscience&commit=Search)) covers RL and TD Learning as it relates to neuroscience in Chapter 9. Some of the figures from the class lectures are from this chapter.

- One of the original papers that linked the activity of primate dopamine cells during appetitive conditioning tasks with temporal difference learning was [A Framework for Mesencephalic Dopamine Systems Based on
Predictive Hebbian Learning](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/16/5/1936.full.pdf) by Montague, Dayan, Sejnowski (1996)

- A more recent paper that might be of interest for a project is  
[Models of heterogeneous dopamine signaling in an insect learning and memory center](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/737064v2). They build an RNN based on the fly mushroom body (the center of olfactory learning) in PyTorch and customized the plasticity rules. Ashok is a professor at Columbia.
