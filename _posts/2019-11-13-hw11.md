### Due Tuesday, November 19 at 11:59 pm on Gradescope. 

There are approximately 2-3 weeks left for you to work on your projects. Please take the time to work on your projects!

1. (10 pts) Read [Sex as an Algorithm: The Theory of Evolution Under the Lens of Computation](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/11/209128-sex-as-an-algorithm/fulltext) by Livnat and Papadimitriou. Write a few paragraphs summarizing what you found interesting. Example question: how might some of this material be related to the brain?

3. (5 pts) Submit two discussion questions on any topic of your choice =)

4. (40 pts) Submit a draft of your project. This can either be:
    * A **draft of your paper** that is significantly updated from your project proposal
    * OR a **github repo** with a clear explanation (atleast a paragraph or two) of what you did, what code you wrote, and how it fits into the project. You can add this paragraph to your poject proposal.
    
Please note that your final project is due on December 9 (the last day of classes). If you are writing a review paper, please write 8-10 pages (single spaced) with clear motivations/questions that are addressed in the body of the paper (and clear connections between the brain and computation). If you are doing a coding project, please submit a well-organized github repo and a short write up of what you did, what worked, and what didn't work (this can be an expanded version of your project proposal). Make sure to make some well explained connnection to the brain and computation.
