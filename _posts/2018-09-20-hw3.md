### Due Wednesday, Sept. 26 at 12 pm on Gradescope. 

1. How are your plans for the project shaping up? Please write a paragraph on the status of your ideas for your project. 

2. Watch either BOTH these two talks on the thalamus by Murray Sherman [[1]](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/sherman-thalamocortical-i ) [[2]](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/sherman-thalamocortical-ii), OR you can watch this less accessible, but shorter talk (also by Sherman) [[3]](
https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/s-murray-sherman-2-13-18)

3. Read [these notes on convolutional neural nets](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/). What did you learn? Feel free to check out more of the topics in the class if you want to read up on CNNs.

4. Read the [Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530) paper by Zhang et. al. Optional: If you are curious to learn more on this topic, there is another [paper by Belkin et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01396) which asserts similar claims for kernel learning, and there is even [more recent follow-up work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05161).

5. Read Part 2. The Brain of [von Neumann's book]((https://archive.org/details/TheComputerAndTheBrain))

4. Submit an at least 1-page (max 5 page) response to Gradescope (see Piazza for some further instructions.) The response should include the following:

  - At least a paragraph for each of items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 that summarizes what you found interesting and makes it clear you've done the assignment carefully.

  - Two discussion points/questions you'd like to touch on in class. Also post these on Piazza after you submit your assignment!
