Work on your projects! And enjoy Thanksgiving =)

------------------------


**PROJECT PRESENTATIONS** (December 4)
Please prepare a ~10 minute presentation on your project. Be sure to motivate your presentation with a connection to the brain and computation and material from the course.
    

**FINAL PROJECT DRAFT** (December 9)
Please note that your final project is due on December 9 (the last day of classes). If you are writing a review paper, please write 8-10 pages (single spaced) with clear motivations/questions that are addressed in the body of the paper (and clear connections between the brain and computation). If you are doing a coding project, please submit a well-organized github repo and a short write up of what you did, what worked, and what didn't work (this can be an expanded version of your project proposal). Make sure to make some well explained connection to the brain and computation.


 
 Here are some important dates:


* _November 27 - Thanksgiving Eve_ (No Lecture)

* December 4 (Lecture 13)
    * Final Project Presentations
