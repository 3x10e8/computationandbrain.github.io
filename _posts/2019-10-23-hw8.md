### Due Tuesday, October 29 at 11:59 pm on Gradescope. 

TBD 

1. (10 pts) Skim the rest of Chapter 1 (Sections 1.6-1.9, i.e. pp. 56-86) and read the entirety of Chapter 2 (pp. 86-100) of Angela Friederici's book [Language Functions in the Brain: From Auditory Input to Sentence Comprehension](https://mitpress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7551/mitpress/9780262036924.001.0001/upso-9780262036924-chapter-002) (available via [CLIO](https://clio.columbia.edu/quicksearch?q=Language+in+Our+Brain%3A+The+Origins+of+a+Uniquely+Human+Capacity&commit=Search)). Feel free to skip the sections on prosody. Write a few paragraphs about topics you find interesting.

2. (30 pts) Please submit a 1-2 page project proposal. Clearly state your research question(s) and explain how you plan to approach/tackle them. Cite atleast 2-3 relevant sources directly related to your project. As stated in the general course page, the final project and presentation should consist of one of the following:

   * Review of a topic relevant to computation and the brain not discussed in class; 

   * A programming-based project: Implement some interesting form of computation the brain may perform and see what conclusions you can draw from simulations. Alternatively, you can use real brain-related data and analyze it with computational techniques. 

   * A theoretical research project: Attempt to formalize with mathematics some interesting mechanisms the brain may implement. 

   See [Rob Schapire's advice](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring14/cos511/project.html) (more specialized for theoretical machine learning) on projects for some good tips.
