### Due Wednesday, Oct. 3 at 12 pm on Gradescope. 

1. Watch Jeff Lichtman on "Mapping Neural Connections and Their Development" [[part I]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2US2yVO4us&t=1s) [[part II]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alIu9NeLbZs)

2. Read ["Random synaptic feedback weights support error backpropagation for deep learning"](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13276.pdf) by Lillicrap et. al. 

3. Read Section 2 (pgs. 2---7) of [Witten's Mini-Introduction to Information Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11965.pdf)

4. Read ["Von Neumann's Contributions to Automata Theory"](http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1958-64-03/S0002-9904-1958-10214-1/S0002-9904-1958-10214-1.pdf), a review of von Neumann's work by Claude Shannon, the inventor of information theory. 

5. For fun (optional): ["A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence"](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/dartmouth/dartmouth.html) --- This interesting historical document is what kickstarted the field of artificial intelligence as it is currently known. They believed they would solve the problem in just one summer! 

6. Submit an at least 1-page (max 5 page) response to Gradescope (see Piazza for some further instructions.) The response should include the following:

  - At least a paragraph for each of items 1, 2, 3, and 4 that summarizes what you found interesting and makes it clear you've done the assignment carefully.

  - Two discussion points/questions you'd like to touch on in class. Also post these on Piazza after you submit your assignment!
