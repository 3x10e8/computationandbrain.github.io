### Due Wednesday, Nov 28 at 12 pm on Gradescope. 


1. Please watch [A Fireside Chat with Manuel Blum](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/fireside-chat-with-manuel-blum/). 

2. Please watch Chelsea Finn on [Building Unsupervised Versatile Agents with Meta-Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i05Fk4ebMY0&feature=youtu.be).  

3. Please read [the Wikipedia page on consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness).

4. Submit an at least 1-page (max 5 page) response to Gradescope (see Piazza for some further instructions.) The response should include the following:

  - At least a paragraph for each of items 1, 2 and 3 that summarizes what you found interesting and makes it clear you've done the assignment carefully.

  - One discussion point/question you'd like to touch on in class (Discussion Q1). Also post it on Piazza after you submit your assignment!

5. On Piazza, choose someone else's discussion question to respond to (ideally one which not a lot of people have already responded to), and write a thoughtful reply. Copy this reply onto the homework as well (in answer to Discussion Q2).
