1. Please watch Chris Manning on [NLP and Deep Learning](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/christopher-manning-2017-3-27). 

2. Please read Lake et. al. on ["One shot learning of simple visual concepts"](https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt4ht821jx/qt4ht821jx.pdf). 

3. Please read Hauser et. al. on ["The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?"](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5598/1569)

4. For fun: watch this [monkey video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meiU6TxysCg)

4. Submit an at least 1-page (max 5 page) response to Gradescope (see Piazza for some further instructions.) The response should include the following:

  - At least a paragraph for each of items 1, 2 and 3 that summarizes what you found interesting and makes it clear you've done the assignment carefully.

  - One discussion points/questions you'd like to touch on in class (Discussion Q1). Also post it on Piazza after you submit your assignment!

5. On Piazza, choose someone else's discussion question to respond to (ideally one which not a lot of people have already responded to), and write a thoughtful reply. Copy this reply onto the homework as well (in answer to Discussion Q2).
