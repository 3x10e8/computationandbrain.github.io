### Due Tuesday, Sept. 17 at 11:59 pm on Gradescope. 

The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce the introductory material on visual neuroscience from the lecture, and to expose you to some recent research in computational neuroscience. This assignment involves >2 hours of video lectures, so be sure to plan accordingly. Please review all the material and summarize. Unlike last weeks homework, you do not have to answer every sub-question.

1. Watch [this talk by Bruno Olshausen](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/olshausen-neural) on the Neural Mechanisms of Vision. Summarize the parts of the talk that you find interesting. Be sure to include *some* of the following questions:
    1. What is an "ON" cell and an "OFF" cell?
    2. What is a center-surround?
    3. What was Horace Barlow's important hypothesis i.e. efficient coding?
    4. What is the main result of the "Efficient Coding Model of Retina" (Karklin and Simoncelli 2011) mentioned in the talk? Why do you think this is interesting?


2. Read the paper ["Emergence of Simple-Cell Receptive Field Properties by Learning a Sparse Code for Natural Images", by Olshausen and Field](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~tony/vns/readings/olshausen-field-1996.pdf). Summarize the parts of the paper that you find interesting. Be sure to include *some* of the following questions:
    1. What is a "simple" cell? What is a "complex" cell? Do you think this is a good distinction to make?
    2. Why is this an exciting/celebrated result? 
  

3. Take a break from the paper and watch [this talk by Jack Gallant](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/jack-gallant-2-15-18) on "An Accurate Functional Model of Single Neurons in V1, V2 and V4". Summarize the parts of the talk that you find interesting. Be sure to include *some* of the following questions:
    1. What is a spike triggered average? (You might have to look it up - it is an important tool in neuroscience)
    2. A lot of psychology/cognitive science/neuroscience experiments involve synthetic stimuli such as moving gratings. Why might "natural" images be important? How might synthetic images be experimentally useful?
    3. How is this related to the way people think about deep nets?
    4. So...what do you think V4 does?

4. (Mathematical exercise TBD)


5. What are two discussion points/questions that you have? (We will choose some of these to discuss in class)

Submit a (preferably LaTeX formatted) summary (~2 pages) to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/61715). Please sign up as per the instructions on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/columbia/fall2019/comse6998_004_2019_1topicsincomputerscience). 

Thanks, and enjoy!

The model discussed in the Gallant talk is not published. However his group has a recent bioRxiv paper on a similar model [The DeepTune framework for modeling and
characterizing neurons in visual cortex area V4](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/11/09/465534.full.pdf)
