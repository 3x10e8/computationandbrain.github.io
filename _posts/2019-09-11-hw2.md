### Due Tuesday, Sept. 17 at 11:59 pm on Gradescope. 

The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce the introductory material on vision neuroscience from lecture, and to expose you to some recent research in computational neuroscience.

1. Watch [this talk by Bruno Olshausen](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/olshausen-neural) on the Neural Mechanisms of Vision. Summarize the parts of the talk that you find interesting. Be sure to include some of the following questions:
    1. What is an "ON" cell and an "OFF" cell?
    2. What is a center-surround?
    3. What was Horace Barlow's important hypothesis?
    4. What is the main result of the "Efficient Coding Model of Retina" (Karklin and Simoncelli 2012) mentioned in the talk? Why do you think this is interesting?


2. Read the paper ["Emergence of Simple-Cell Receptive Field Properties by Learning a Sparse Code for Natural Images", by Olshausen and Field](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~tony/vns/readings/olshausen-field-1996.pdf). Summarize the parts of the talk that you find interesting. Be sure to include some of the following questions:
    1. What is a "simple" cell? What is a "complex" cell? Do you think this is a good distinction to make?
    2. What is efficient coding? How does this relate to Barlow (this might be a trick question)? 
  

3. Take a break from the paper and watch [this talk by Jack Gallant](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/jack-gallant-2-15-18) on "An Accurate Functional Model of Single Neurons in V1, V2 and V4". Summarize the parts of the talk that you find interesting. Be sure to include some of the following questions:
    1. What does V4 do?

4. (Mathematical exercise TBD)


5. What are two discussion points/questions that you have? (We will choose some of these to discuss in class)

Submit a (preferably LaTeX formatted) summary (~2 pages) to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/61715). Please sign up as per the instructions on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/columbia/fall2019/comse6998_004_2019_1topicsincomputerscience). 

Thanks, and enjoy!
