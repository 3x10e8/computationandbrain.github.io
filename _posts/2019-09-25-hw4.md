### Due Tuesday, October 1 at 11:59 pm on Gradescope. 


The purpose of this assignment is to build an intuition for how complicated a single neuron can be, and to ultimately appreciate the level of abstraction that we use in neural nets:

#### Background

1. (10 pts) Watch this lecture on biophysical models of neurons ["Biophysics of Computation I" by Bartlett Mel](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/mel-biophysics-i). Summarize what you find interesting in 1-2 paragraphs. Feel free to include the following topics:
    1.
    2.
    3.

2. (10 pts) As background, read/skim [Chapter 5 of "Theoretical Neuroscience"](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/columbia/detail.action?docID=3338869) (accessible via [CLIO](https://clio.columbia.edu/quicksearch?q=theoretical+neuroscience+abbott&commit=Search)) with a focus on sections 5.5 "Voltage Dependent Conductances" and 5.6 "The Hodgkin-Huxley Model." Answer the following questions in a few sentences and/or equations:
    1. What is a neuronal membrane potential, and what determines its value?
    2. What is the resting potential? What is the reversal potential?
    3. What are voltage-dependent conductances?

_It is hard to gain an appreciation for this model without simulating it. Simulate this model with the following parameters and include plots and your code in your summary. Be careful to use the update rules articulated in Appendix 5.11 in "Theoretical Neuroscience." Another helpful resource re simulation is ["Mathematics for Neuroscientists" by Gabbiani, Section 4.3](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/book/9780128018958/mathematics-for-neuroscientists)_

#### Simulation

3. (10 pts) Build a Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron by numerically integrating the equations for V, m, h, and n given in chapter 5 (see, in particular equations 5.6, 5.17â€“5.19, 5.22, 5.24, and 5.25). Take cm = 10 nF/mm2 , and as initial values take: V = 65 mV, m = 0:0529, h = 0:5961, and n = 0:3177. Use an integration time step of 0.1 ms. 
    1. Use an external current with Ie=A = 200 nA/mm2 and plot V, m, h, and n as functions of time for a suitable interval.     2. Plot the firing rate of the model as a function of Ie=A over the range from 0 to 500 nA/mm2 . 
    3. Show that the firing rate jumps discontinuously from zero to a finite value when the current passes through the minimum value required to produce sustained firing. 
    4. Finally, apply a pulse of negative current with Ie=A = 50 nA/mm2 for 5 ms followed by Ie=A = 0 and show what happens

4. (5 pts) What are two discussion points/questions that you have? (We will choose some of these to discuss in class)

5. (5 pts) Please submit a few sentences brainstorming your thoughts for potential project(s). Feel free to reference any of the papers from lectures or from the homeworks. Be prepared to discuss in class

Submit a (preferably LaTeX formatted) summary to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/61715).

Thanks, and enjoy!
