### Due Wednesday, Nov 7 at 12 pm on Gradescope. 

0. Reach out to the TA assigned to your project (please check the Google Sheets document linked to on Piazza) and schedule a project meeting with all group members for sometime next week. Be ready to discuss some details!

1. Please watch Matt Botvinick on ["The prefrontal cortex as a meta-reinforcement learning system"](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/matthew-botvinick-4-16-18)

2. Please read ["Deep learning reaches the motor system"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0152-6) by Batista and DiCarlo. 

3. Please read ["Neural population dynamics during reaching"](https://search.proquest.com/docview/1024820409?pq-origsite=360link) by Churchland et al. 

4. Submit an at least 1-page (max 5 page) response to Gradescope (see Piazza for some further instructions.) The response should include the following:

  - At least a paragraph for each of items 1, 2 and 3 that summarizes what you found interesting and makes it clear you've done the assignment carefully.

  - One discussion points/questions you'd like to touch on in class. Also post it on Piazza after you submit your assignment!

5. On Piazza, choose someone else's discussion question to respond to (ideally one which not a lot of people have already responded to), and write a thoughtful reply.
