1. Please watch Matt Botvinnick on ["The prefrontal cortex as a meta-reinforcement learning system"](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/matthew-botvinick-4-16-18)

2. Please read ["Deep learning reaches the motor system"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0152-6) by Batista and DiCarlo.

4. Submit an at least 1-page (max 5 page) response to Gradescope (see Piazza for some further instructions.) The response should include the following:

  - At least a paragraph for each of items 1, 2 and 3 that summarizes what you found interesting and makes it clear you've done the assignment carefully.
