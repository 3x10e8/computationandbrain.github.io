### Description

Despite a deluge of exciting results in experimental and theoretical neuroscience over the past decades, some of the top researchers in the area agree that progress has been slow on the field's overarching question:  How does the Brain (molecules, neurons, synapses) give rise to the Mind (cognition, behavior, learning, thought)?  This is arguably one of the hardest and most fundamental challenges in science today.  Many expect that computation will be an important workhorse, conceptual framework, and metaphor of this epic interdisciplinary scientific effort.  On another front, advances in machine learning have often been inspired by the Brain, albeit in a pointedly tentative way. 

The purpose of this course is to give participants some of the necessary background for appreciating this fascinating interface between **computation and neuroscience**, with an emphasis on **language**.  The class will meet once a week for a lecture and discussion, often preceded by a talk by a guest speaker.  There will be substantial weekly reading assignments.  The class will culminate in a project (by teams of 2-3 participants), typically further exploring an aspect of the subject, or framing it in a productive mathematical/computational way.  

There will be no required textbook, but (the latest edition of) [The Principles of Neuroscience](https://neurology.mhmedical.com/book.aspx?bookID=1049) is a valuable resource for molecular through systems neuroscience.

Several other learning resources can be found [here](/resources).

List of topics:

* General Introduction
* Vision and neural coding
* Neuron models, perceptron, and hierarchical neural nets
* Synapses and connectomics
* Learning and plasticity
* Motion and decisions
* Memory, hippocampus, place and grid cells
* Natural language
* Assemblies of neurons
* On evolution and development

Tentative topics:
* The Other Brain (thalamus, cerebellum, glia, basal ganglia, spinal cord,â€¦)
* Reinforcement learning

      
(NB: the precise list will be influenced by class reaction and interest)

### Prerequisites

Some exposure to programming, algorithms, complexity theory, and machine learning is required. Neuroscience background will also be useful. Some homework assignments will include programming and proof-based problems.

Keep in mind this is a graduate level topics course --- the class will be structured around participation in discussions and reading papers, some of which will be theoretical in nature. 

### Evaluation

* Attendance at the lecture each week

* Doing the assigned reading and writing up a graded one-page discussion each week, to be posted on Gradescope. Also, include two questions about the material in preparation for the class. 

* Participating in class discussions (and hopefully on Piazza as well!)

* Final (group-based) project: One of 

   * Review of a topic relevant to computation and the brain not discussed in class; 

   * A programming-based project: Implement some interesting form of computation the brain may perform and see what conclusions you can draw from simulations. Alternatively, you can use real brain-related data and analyze it with computational techniques. 

   * A theoretical research project: Attempt to formalize with mathematics some interesting mechanisms the brain may implement. 

   See [Rob Schapire's advice](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring14/cos511/project.html) (more specialized for theoretical machine learning) on projects for some good tips.  

### Homework assignments
