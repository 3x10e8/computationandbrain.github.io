## Possible Questions

1. Hodgkin and Huxley recieved the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963 for their work on ionic mechanisms underlying the initiation and propagation of action potentials (in the squid giant axon). This work was articulated in a series of papers from 1952, the last of which was titled _A Quantitaive Description of Membrane Current and its Application to Conduction and Excitation in Nerve_. This seminal paper is somewhat difficult to read, but given some background, it should be possible to parse through the important points.
    1. As background, read/skim Chapter 5 of [Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/columbia/detail.action?docID=3338869) (accessible via [CLIO](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/13025930?counter=1) with a focus on sections 5.5 "Voltage Dependent Conductances" and 5.6 "The Hodgkin-Huxley Model."
    
    2. Read/skim the original paper [A Quantitaive Description of Membrane Current and its Application to Conduction and Excitation in Nerve](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392413/pdf/jphysiol01442-0106.pdf) and summarize in your own words how they arrived at their 4-equations:
